statically typed:
every var has type
there is the object for each type 
object inheritance is done while compiling


bool
byte
sbyte
realno:
decimal
double 

stack are fast access, array of memory
heap are slower than stack

 changing types from double to int 
 decimal decimalval = 10;
 this method of conversion is called explicit conversion
 int valD = (int)decimalval;


finding type 
(var1 * var2 ).GetType()

value comparision === is not available in C#
== is availble for value comparision
