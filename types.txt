statically typed:
every var has type
there is the object for each type 
object inheritance is done while compiling


bool
byte
sbyte
realno:
decimal
double 

stack are fast access, array of memory
heap are slower than stack

 changing types from double to int 
 decimal decimalval = 10;
 this method of conversion is called explicit conversion
 int valD = (int)decimalval;


finding type 
(var1 * var2 ).GetType()

value comparision === is not available in C#
== is availble for value comparision
 decimal = m at last
 double = d at last or normal integers

 display(30.0m == 30d);
 Operator '==' cannot be applied to operands of type 'decimal' and "double";
DateTime todayobj = new DateTime(2020,1,8,9,0,0);

DateTime.Now()
